It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator. So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again. And, yes, together we will make America great again. Trump\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s inaugural address, reportedly written by chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior advisor Stephen Miller, was criticized as aggressive, but it was largely an effort to explain what he meant by \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cMake America Great Again,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d which is (thankfully!) a very aggressive idea. For an example of a passive campaign theme, try \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHope and Change. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d There is nothing more passive than lying around and hoping some Santa Claus politician comes along with a bag of other people\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s money to fix your life.  Trump was also criticized for delivering an inaugural address that sounded too much like his campaign speeches. This was necessary, because the mainstream media didn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t relay enough of what he said on the stump. They were too busy freaking out over whatever \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009coutrageous\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d thing he said at any given rally.  It was appropriate for Trump to succinctly explain his platform to the widest audience he\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll ever have, both within and beyond America\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s borders, with no media filter. Until now, most of the media commentary on \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cMake America Great Again\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d consisted of whining about how unfair it was to the inexplicably   Barack Obama, mixed with the occasional lefty primal scream about how America was never great to begin with. Perhaps most importantly, Trump used his inaugural to beat down the asinine smear of \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cwhite nationalism. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d His talk of national pride has been corrupted to mean unthinking national chauvinism by the Left. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAmerica first\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is twisted to mean \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cscrew everybody but America\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d (or, in the hands of the more mendacious critics, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cscrew the Jews. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) Then it gets twisted even further by welding the unspoken word \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cwhite\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d onto \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnationalism,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d transforming it into a racist call to arms. The number of actual white nationalists who talk about white nationalism is vastly smaller than the number of liberals who insist that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s what they hear when Trump talks about \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAmerican pride. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Maybe it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time for liberals to check in with their therapists and have a long talk about why they hear so many racist dog whistles. In his inaugural, Trump could not have been more clear about the inclusiveness of his vision for American pride. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWhether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is about as clear as it gets.  Of course, the usual   media swamis will declare they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve looked inside Trump\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s mind, and he didn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t really mean that. He just threw those words in because Kellyanne told him he needed a little racism insurance. But everything about that speech, and everything Trump has said about resurgent American pride, and everything said by the people who want to reclaim nationalism from chauvinism, is inclusive. The point is to insist on both national priorities and national responsibilities, for everyone from   citizens at the immigration office to President Trump and his Cabinet.  The woman from Mexico who took her oath of citizenship yesterday is 100% American. The man from Mexico who slipped across the border in a coyote truck yesterday is not. President Trump has a long list of sacred duties to the woman, but not to the man. This is not a complicated idea, or a racist one, or really even a nationalist one. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Civics 101. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s also the idea global socialism must strangle, in order to survive. Liberals who rail against \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnationalism\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d are primarily interested in creating a world of zero accountability for their maximum leaders. With borders erased, the Ruling Class can hack the electorate to suit its political needs, and their business partners can slash the cost of labor. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cInternationalist\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d leaders are accountable to no nation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s citizens. Trump\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s inaugural address included a bold statement of the opposite principle. America\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s president has neither control, nor responsibility, over the economies of other nations. He is responsible to Americans, from Nebraska to Detroit, as Trump put it. He set a very high bar for himself to clear by pointedly mentioning Detroit.  He also made a promise that no group will be preyed upon for the advantages of another. To be the president of all Americans means he is the sugar daddy of none. No more will the power of government be used to penalize groups the Left hates, and beat them into line with new social orthodoxies. No more will Washington dream up economic plans that benefit some, or even most, while designating certain \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cforgotten people\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d as lifetime losers who need to shut up and accept their fate.  Trump referred to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cwealth\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d several times in his speech. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWealth\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d means more than just money. Wealth benefits all, no matter how loudly socialists may screech about too much of it accruing to the One Percent. Some people got very rich by designing, building, and selling the device you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re staring at right now. You are wealthier than your grandparents, because you have it. As for a proud America\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s proper relationship with other nations, Trump said: We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow. That\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s not chauvinism, or imperialism. That\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s the understanding America was founded upon. When Thomas Jefferson took his turn at the presidential bat, he called for \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cpeace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d No one interpreted that to mean \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cto Hell with the rest of the world. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Also, not to put too fine a point on it, but just about every other nation on Earth understands the concept of putting its own interests first, and believes it has a moral obligation to do so. The leaders of some other nations are very good at murmuring sweet globalist nothings into the ears of   elites, but what they actually do is ruthlessly pursue their own national interests. The charade is made much easier for them by the universal understanding that America is supposed to be the one country that never gets to look out for itself, that has no moral right to protect its own interests. Those are all much easier promises to make than keep, to be sure, but Trump did make them. It is wise to be skeptical, and hold his feet to the very large fire he built with that inaugural address.\",\n          \"Hackers have stolen Disney\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s upcoming film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and have threatened to release it online unless the studio pays the thieves a hefty ransom, according to reports. [Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed Monday at a town hall meeting with ABC employees in New York City that one of the studio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s upcoming films had been stolen, but did not specify which film, according to the Hollywood Reporter.  Deadline reported later Monday that the film in question is the studio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean, the fifth film in the swashbuckling pirates franchise starring Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. The studio is working with the FBI to identify the source of the hack. The hackers have reportedly threatened to release portions of the film online until their ransom demand is met. THR reported that the hackers planned to release the first five minutes of the film and then continue on with   increments until payment is made. Sources told Deadline that Disney is not currently planning to pay the ransom, though the studio has not yet commented publicly on the situation. The Disney hack comes as studios and production outfits have dealt with increasing security threats presented by hackers. Even if hacking groups cannot access private files on the server of a major studio like Disney, they can attack   outfits or other   firms that possess copies of private material and that have weaker security measures than major companies. In April, a group of hackers calling themselves The Dark Overlord infiltrated Netflix and released all ten episodes of the streaming giant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s hit series Orange is the New Black, after the company refused to meet the group\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s ransom demand. That group also said it possessed stolen copies of other television shows including Celebrity Apprentice and NCIS: Los Angeles. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is due out in theaters May 26.

Mr. Bissonnette also recently forfeited $180, 000 in fees for consulting work that he did for military contractors while he was still on the SEAL team, his lawyer, Robert D. Luskin, said in an interview. If approved by a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. the royalty settlement would bring an end to more than two years of civil and criminal investigations into Mr. Bissonnette, who won several awards for valor in Iraq and Afghanistan before writing \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNo Easy Day,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d his   book on the Bin Laden raid, under the pen name Mark Owen. The firsthand account of the daring raid was one of several   books and movies involving former Navy SEALS that has led to criticism within a community once known for discretion that Mr. Bissonnette and the others were cashing in on their exploits. The Justice Department conducted criminal investigations into whether Mr. Bissonnette had disclosed classified information in his book or speeches and whether he had violated    laws in consulting for companies that had contracts with SEAL Team 6. In the end, the department did not bring any criminal charges, settling instead for the cash forfeitures. Mr. Bissonnette said in a statement Friday that he regretted his failure to submit \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNo Easy Day\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d for vetting before it was published in 2012 so Pentagon officials could ensure that it did not include classified information. Mr. Bissonnette acknowledged that he was required under his security clearances to let the Pentagon review the book, and he blamed another lawyer for advising him that he did not need to do so. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI acknowledge my mistake and have paid a stiff price, both personally and financially, for that error,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI accept responsibility for failing to submit the book for review and apologize sincerely for my oversight. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Documents filed in Federal District Court in Alexandria on Friday indicated that Mr. Bissonnette must transfer nearly $6. 8 million to the government as part of the settlement. The amount includes all of the $6. 7 million in royalties he has earned on \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNo Easy Day,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d as well as $100, 000 in fees for six speeches he gave in early 2013 before the government approved the slides he used in such presentations. Mr. Bissonnette wrote in \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNo Easy Day\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d that he was one of the SEALs who shot Bin Laden, and he and Robert O\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Neill, another former SEAL Team 6 member who claims his shots were the fatal ones, have competed on the lecture circuit. Military officials said that Mr. O\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Neill is writing a book of his own and has asked the Pentagon to vet it. While Mr. Bissonnette\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s fight with the Pentagon over his book has received public attention, some details of his consulting work while he was still a SEAL Team 6 member, as well as his fee forfeiture, have not been disclosed. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and the federal authorities reached a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnonprosecution agreement\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in May in which Mr. Bissonnette forfeited $180, 000 in fees for advising three equipment manufacturers who were doing business with SEAL Team 6 while he was on the team. Mr. Luskin said the fees dated back as far as 2006, when Mr. Bissonnette was the research and development representative for his squadron within Team 6. Other former SEAL members have said that his job was to figure out what types of equipment they needed. Mr. Luskin said that the $180, 000 came from   a helmet maker now owned by the Gentex Corporation in Carbondale, Pa. and two   manufacturers based in Virginia Beach  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094   SS Precision and London Bridge Trading. No executives at the three companies were available for comment. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and other SEAL members also received consulting fees from companies that designed tactical clothing and gear for other parts of the military or for sales to outdoor enthusiasts. Mr. Bissonnette has maintained that he cleared the consulting work in advance with a Navy lawyer, and Mr. Luskin said that helped persuade prosecutors that \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cthere was clearly on Matt\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s part no intent to breach the    laws. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Navy officials say they have restricted such moonlighting since then. Mr. Luskin also noted that a number of   officials have assisted other authors writing about the Bin Laden raid as well as the creators of the movie \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cZero Dark Thirty. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d But, he said, only Mr. Bissonnette has paid any penalties for the disclosures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
